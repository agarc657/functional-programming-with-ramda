# Functional Programming with Ramda
There are aspects of Functional Programming that can be easily leveraged in your current JavaScript codebase to help you write cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable code. In particular, function composition allows you to chain together multiple functions to make sophisticated systems out of simple parts. Ramda is a JavaScript utility library that can help you to write clean, concise and functional code. It makes function composition simple.

### Running code snippets
The code snippets can be run in your terminal with Node.js (make sure you are using Node v8.0.0 or higher).

To experiment with the code snippets you can clone the repo and start a Node instance:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/leggechr/functional-programming-with-ramda.git
$ cd functional-programming-with-ramda
$ node
```

Then in the node shell, load in the code snippet you want:
```sh
> .load CodeSnippets/file-name.js
```

At this point you can call any of the defined functions and experiment with their behaviour.

### Running the Tweet graph demo
The code from the Tweet graph demo can be run:
```sh
$ node tweetAnalyzer.js
```
